Cockroaches
==============

This repository is where all the code from cockroach project will be stored. The code for the robots is written in Arduino, a variant of C. See http://www.arduino.cc/ for more information.     

Hardware
---------
Teensy USB Development Board 3.0   
https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/   

Scripts 
--------
I have included a set up script which will download all necessary software to get the Arduino IDE up and running.   
The Arduino IDE stores all programs you create in a folder called sketchbook, which I did not want to use as my git repo. so I have also included roachscript which will copy all programs to the cockroaches repository.
